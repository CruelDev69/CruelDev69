<h2>Hey! I am glad you found this. I am Ahad Noor and I introduce myself as a [bot developer](https://www.vivre.cf), [web developer](https://www.itscruel.cf) and guess what? I also happen to be a [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5vCNtDoHuJTOMD8oqL7AgQ). I am learning Java script, python, c++, html and, take a breath, css. After spending too many hours on the screen ( i am not an actor) , I realized there's a world inside another world and I want you to join my little world aka my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ncsc5pRNgf).<h2>
